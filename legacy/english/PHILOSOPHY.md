Why years are discarded

The Earth’s orbit is continuous and does not consist of an integer number of days.
Years are therefore not discrete units, but accounting approximations.

Any system that treats years as exact containers of days must introduce corrections (leap years), which are not physical phenomena, but bookkeeping devices.

For a personal time system:

- years are unnecessary
- years are misleading
- years break positional notation

Therefore, this system does not use years as a unit.

Why decimal

Decimal grouping offers:

- predictability
- mental arithmetic
- regular habit cycles
- positional notation

Blocks of 10 days are short enough to feel natural, and long enough to structure routines.

Bottom-up construction

Traditional calendars are built top-down:

"We have a year, let’s divide it."

This system is built bottom-up:

"We have days; how should we group them optimally?"
