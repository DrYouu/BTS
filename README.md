Personal Decimal Block Calendar

This repository documents a personal, deterministic, decimal-based time indexing system designed to replace traditional calendars (weeks, months, years) for personal organization, habit tracking, and life indexing.

The system is:

based on days as atomic units

purely decimal (base 10)

regular and uniform

independent from civil calendars, leap years, and cultural conventions

compatible with existing systems via conversion

This is not a proposal to replace civil time globally.
It is a personal time model, designed to align better with cognition, habits, and long-term personal development.

Core idea (TL;DR)

Time is continuous.

Days are counted from a personal origin (birth).

Days are grouped into blocks of 10 days.

Larger structures are built bottom-up, not by dividing years.

There are no months, weeks, or years as structural units.

Example date:

B1325,3


Meaning:

Block 1325 since origin

Day 3 within that block

Why this exists

Traditional calendars suffer from:

irregular months

arbitrary week lengths

leap years as accounting patches

poor alignment with habits and routines

poor numeric intuition

This system removes all of that.

Status
