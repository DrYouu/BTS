Why years are discarded

The Earth’s orbit is continuous and does not consist of an integer number of days.
Years are therefore not discrete units, but accounting approximations.

Any system that treats years as exact containers of days must introduce corrections (leap years), which are not physical phenomena, but bookkeeping devices.

For a personal time system:

years are unnecessary

years are misleading

years break positional notation

Therefore, this system does not use years as a unit.

Why decimal

Decimal grouping offers:

predictability

mental arithmetic

regular habit cycles

positional notation

Blocks of 10 days are short enough to feel natural, and long enough to structure routines.

Bottom-up construction

Traditional calendars are built top-down:

“We have a year, let’s divide it.”

This system is built bottom-up:

“We have days; how should we group them optimally?”
